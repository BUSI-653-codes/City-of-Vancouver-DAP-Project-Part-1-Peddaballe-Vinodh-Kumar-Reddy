# Project Description: Descriptive Analysis of Lost and Found Animal Records
In this assignment I will be describing the details of the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implementation (the datasets used and the various derivations and DAP design using the datasets I selected. For this assignment I used the website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023) for getting some open source available datasets for various segments related to the Vancouver City operations.

## Project Title: Understanding Yearly Lost and Found Animal Patterns
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the yearly trends in lost and found animals based on the datasets taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023). The goal is to identify the percentage of animals matched (found) and lost over time, which can help inform operational strategies for animal control services, improve response times, and increase the likelihood of reuniting lost animals with their owners.
### Project Objective:
* Pets have become a major part of our lives.
* I decided this will be my dataset to get information related to lost and found cases related to pets in city of Vancouver.
* For the DAP design there are close to 17 steps. Am going to define and describe all these steps below.
